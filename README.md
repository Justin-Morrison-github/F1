Personal Project currently in development .
This project is meant to be wrapper that works with the Ergast F1 web API to fetch and display F1 data. Link to Ergast API here: https://ergast.com/mrd/

NOTE: The Ergast API is deprecated and will be shut down at the end of 2024. 
Its creators refer users to try the alpha version of its replacement Jolpica https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1. 

After getting this project operational I will likely be switching to Jolpica to ensure the project still works in the future.
