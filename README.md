# F1 API Wrapper

Personal Project currently in development .
This project is meant to be wrapper that works with the [Ergast F1](https://ergast.com/mrd/) web API to fetch and display F1 data.

## NOTE: The Ergast API is deprecated and will be shut down at the end of 2024. 
Its creators refer users to try the alpha version of its replacement [Jolpica](https://github.com/jolpica/jolpica-f1). 

After getting this project operational I will likely be switching to Jolpica to ensure the project works in the future.
